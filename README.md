# Tagalog Scraper :ledger:
Collects [Tagalog](http://tagaloglang.com/) words from [tagalog.pinoydictionary.com](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/), a database of [Tagalog](http://tagaloglang.com/) words powered by Cyberspace.ph Web Hosting using web scraping and web crawling techniques.
## How it is done? :muscle:
Each webpage is loaded and parsed, extracting the words enclosed in `<dt>` tag.

Included is [`tagalog.pinoydictionary.com`](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/) `html` [snippet](https://github.com/raymelon/tagalog-scraper/blob/master/tagalog.pinoydictionary.com%20html%20snippet.html) containing the source of
[`http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/list/a/`](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/list/a/) to serve as guide and overview on how dictionary words from the page are extracted.

**Disclaimer:**
I do not own the `html` code cited above, it is owned by [tagalog.pinoydictionary.com](http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/).

## How did the project started? :thought_balloon:
Originally it is intented for a [Scrabble Â®](http://www.scrabble.com/) Tagalog dictionary database, but other uses may vary.

## Tools :pencil2:
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/) :snake:
- [Beautiful Soup 4.5.1](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) :ramen: :package:
```
  python -m pip install -U pip beautifulsoup4
```

## Notes :pushpin:
- `tagalog_dict.txt` is where the scraper [`collect_tagalog.py`](https://github.com/raymelon/tagalog-scraper/blob/master/collect_tagalog.py) puts the collected words.
- The output file [`tagalog_dict.txt`](https://github.com/raymelon/tagalog-scraper/blob/master/tagalog_dict.txt) will be updated from time to time to ensure up-to-date collection. :date:
